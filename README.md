# MyUnorderedMap

- My implementation of the unordered_map. It was created for learning and for a better figuring out of C++.

- The executable file was obtained and run under Valgrind by the command:
  ```shell
  g++ *.cpp -std=c++14 -Wall -o ./a.out && valgrind ./a.out --leak-check=yes --track-origins=yes
  ```
- Debugging was performed in Visual Studio 2022.
